## Early Iteration




## Challenges

There were so many challenges with this project! One of my first hurdles was finding a way to get my questions and answer options to display of the screen. I watched so many tutorial (see resources), bugged my classmates (thank you all), as well Jeremy and Elektra (thank you as well!!). Through the tutorials I found '.this' and that opened up a whole new world! Although I don't yet fully understand the full capabilities, I was able to utilize it for my project. 

Another challenge I had was simply setting up the HTML. I tried using divs, buttons, spans, and p tags, but my answer choices were not diplaying properly. A website suggested using 'ul' with 'onclick' properies. Again, problem solved! I could fill a novel with the various roadblocks I encountered, but these are some that stick out.

As far as things that didn't quite make it to the final project there were just a few. I am happy with how my project turned out, especially the custom cursor! In a perfect world I would have liked to have a landing page with a start button and some extra photos or gifs. This is a project I plan to continue building out with high score lists, more questions that will be chosen at random, and some video clips.

It was my hope that I made you laugh and forget a worry for a moment. :bee: :bee: :bee: :heart:
